## Dataset descriptions

### TCGA-BLCA

The TCGA-BLCA dataset is a comprehensive characterisation of 409 bladder cancer samples. Available at 
https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-BLCA. 

Data categories: 

* Sequencing Reads: raw sequencing data generated from DNA or RNA sequencing experiments. It contains information about the nucleotide sequence of the DNA or RNA molecules.
* Transcriptome Profiling: information about the expression levels of genes in the bladder cancer samples. It is generated using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments that capture the transcriptome of the cancer cells.
* Simple Nucleotide Variation: single nucleotide variations (SNVs) or point mutations in the DNA sequence of the bladder cancer samples. It is generated using DNA sequencing experiments.
* Copy Number Variation: amplification or deletion of DNA segments in the bladder cancer samples. It is generated using DNA sequencing or microarray-based techniques.
* DNA Methylation: methylation status of DNA (i.e., epigenetic modification that plays a critical role in gene regulation and cellular function) in the bladder cancer samples. It is generated using methylation-specific DNA sequencing or microarray-based techniques.
* Clinical: clinical characteristics of the bladder cancer patients, such as age, sex, tumor stage, and survival outcomes.
* Biospecimen: biological samples used for the molecular analyses, such as the type of tissue or cell line, sample collection date, and quality control metrics.
